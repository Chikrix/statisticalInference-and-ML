## Exercise: Comparing Models
In this exercise our objective will be building a model to identify customers most likely to accept a direct marketing offer.  

I'll be using H~2~O flow, which runs on the browser and is designed to streamline the modelling process. It offers the same functionaliity as the non GUI H~2~O, as well as more insightful output. I'll be using the dataset I imported in the last step, but would import it again here for reproducibility reasons.  

```{r include = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(h2o)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
localH20 <- h2o.init(ip = "127.0.0.1", port = 54321)
```

The above starts the h~2~o server on the ip given address. That is where we import our data, prepare for modelling, and draw our model.
